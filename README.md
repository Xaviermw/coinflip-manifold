# "Coin Flip" Trader

This bot has identified high sample size users that tend to make binary markets that resolve significantly below or above 45%/55% as "Yes" or "No", and will bet up/down to 45%/55% if the bot is the first trader.

There is also a slight generalized trend among low sample size users to create markets that resolve at "No", so the bot will buy 1 Mana of "No" if they are the first trader. 

No coins are flipped, this bot is a lie.
